<h3 font-size="12px"> &nbsp What is Computer Conception?</h3>

<p> Computer Conception is a website that allows the user to build their own custom computer by choosing from a variety of parts while being assisted with hardware compatibility issues.   </p>

<h3> &nbsp Why was Computer Conception created?</h3>
<p>One of the main problems with building your own custom personal computer is that the average user most likely does not know how compatibility issues affect part selection.  Another problem is that commercial vendors of personal computers add on extra charges that could make even a moderately powerful computer unaffordable.  We set out to create an interactive website that assists users in ordering compatible parts for a custom computer, while cutting the price significantly.  We designed and developed Computer Conceptions during our Senior Informatics Capstone class.  It has provided us experience working in teams while planning, prototyping, and development of our IT system.  Our website made use of the following technologies: </p><ul><li>HMTL</li><li>Cascading Style Sheets</li><li>Adobe Dreamweaver</li><li>Adobe Photoshop</li><li>PHP</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Javascript</li></ul>
